# PRU-Gate: Consciousness Interface

## Vision

PRU-Gate is an experimental consciousness project grounded in the Precomputed Relational Universe (PRU) model. It aims to decode brainwave patterns, build a relational map of conscious states, and create a structured, repeatable protocol to consciously access higher awareness or the "Higher Self."

We believe that if the universe is based on information and relationships, then human consciousness can interface with the source through measurable, structured wave signals.

## Goals

1. **Capture** real-time brainwave data (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).
2. **Label** and classify conscious states (e.g. calm, aware, distracted, connected).
3. **Create** a relational database between brainwave patterns and internal states.
4. **Design** stimulation feedback protocols (audio, light, vibration) to guide brainwaves.
5. **Transmit** structured intention signals at peak awareness moments.
6. **Record** feedback (insight, synchronicities, downloads, changes in perception).
7. **Build** a reliable framework for awakening and higher connection.

## PRU: The Chain of Manifestation

> A fundamental philosophical and scientific model for understanding reality, awareness, and causality.

1. **Rules** â€“ The precomputed logical structures of the universe. These are not hardcoded constants, but emergent principles from which constants like `G`, `c`, and `Î±` arise. 

2. **Relations** â€“ The contextual network of everything. All things only exist and behave in relation to other things. Relational logic drives the interaction of all entities.

3. **Consciousness** â€“ The non-local, aware decoder of relational structures. Consciousness is not emergent from the brain â€” the brain tunes into it.

4. **Mind** â€“ The interpretive interface between consciousness and the material world. The mind organizes, filters, and defines intention.

5. **Body** â€“ The physical avatar that executes, senses, and participates in the relational network.

6. **Action / Inaction** â€“ The ripple. The expression of relational influence and intent. Every act redefines the relations and feeds back into the loop.

This is a recursive system:

```
Rules â†’ Relations â†’ Consciousness â†’ Mind â†’ Body â†’ Action â†º Relations
```

## Milestones & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Select EEG hardware (OpenBCI, Muse, etc.)
- [ ] Establish live brainwave data capture
- [ ] Build local relational database structure (SQLite/Firebase)
- [ ] Design JSON/CSV schema for storing brainwave ticks with metadata

### Phase 2: Conscious Mapping
- [ ] Label brainwave sessions manually (meditation, TikTok, breathwork, intention)
- [ ] Store user self-report data
- [ ] Implement pattern visualization and time-based wave mapping
- [ ] Begin correlation analysis between wave combinations and conscious states

### Phase 3: Protocol Creation
- [ ] Implement binaural beat generation (custom Hz based on state)
- [ ] Design light/vibration entrainment protocols
- [ ] Interface to allow user to "Send Signal" (breath + intention marker)
- [ ] Save signal moments with surrounding brainwave data for feedback analysis

### Phase 4: Feedback Loop
- [ ] Track emotional/mental/physical changes after intention signals
- [ ] Include synchronicity/event journaling feature
- [ ] Refine correlation map with received feedback
- [ ] Create repeatable feedback pathways (guided flow to connection)

### Phase 5: Awakening Framework
- [ ] Build personalized map per user (what works best to reach higher self)
- [ ] Offer guided protocols based on real successful patterns
- [ ] Optional shareable protocols for community development

## Core Philosophical Assumption

> Consciousness is non-local. The brain is a relational decoder. Constants are not hardcoded values but emergent properties of relational rules. If we map these inputs well enough, we can modulate experience â€” and potentially connect back to the original signal: the Source.

## Status

ðŸ§  **Early exploration**

Once hardware is acquired, development can begin immediately using this structure.
