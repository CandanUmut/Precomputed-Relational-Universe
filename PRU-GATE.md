# PRU-Gate: Consciousness Interface

## Vision

PRU-Gate is an experimental consciousness project grounded in the Precomputed Relational Universe (PRU) model. It aims to decode brainwave patterns, build a relational map of conscious states, and create a structured, repeatable protocol to consciously access higher awareness or the "Higher Self."

We believe that if the universe is based on information and relationships, then human consciousness can interface with the source through measurable, structured wave signals.

## Goals

1. **Capture** real-time brainwave data (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).
2. **Label** and classify conscious states (e.g. calm, aware, distracted, connected).
3. **Create** a relational database between brainwave patterns and internal states.
4. **Design** stimulation feedback protocols (audio, light, vibration) to guide brainwaves.
5. **Transmit** structured intention signals at peak awareness moments.
6. **Record** feedback (insight, synchronicities, downloads, changes in perception).
7. **Build** a reliable framework for awakening and higher connection.

## Initial Prototype Features

- Simulated brainwave data stream
- Manual tagging of inner state
- Real-time graphing of wave signals
- Sample binaural beat playback (based on user input)
- Button to "Send Signal to Source" + log event
- Local JSON/CSV export of session data

---

## Future Ideas

- AI-trained models to detect "awakening" signatures
- Network-based syncing of intentions + mass coherence experiments
- Integration with breath sensors / HRV monitors
- VR version of guided protocols

## Core Philosophical Assumption

> Consciousness is non-local. The brain is a relational decoder. If we map the relational input well enough, we can modulate our experience â€” and potentially connect back to the original signal: the Source.

## Status

ðŸ§  **Early exploration**

Once hardware is acquired, development can begin immediately using this structure.
