Precomputed Relational Universe (PRU)

A Dual-Lock, Information-Theoretic Derivation of Newton’s Gravitational Constant

Draft v1.0 – July 2025 • Open for public peer review

⸻

Abstract

We model space-time as a deterministic lookup-table graph (Precomputed Relational Universe, PRU) where each node updates once per global tick and is separated from its nearest neighbours by one hop. Each node carries two irreducible information reservoirs (locks):
	1.	Mass-lock U_A [kg] storing resistance bits
	2.	Geometry-lock U_B [m] storing routing metadata bits

The product (U_A U_B)^2 supplies the dimensional factor missing in previous one-lock models, yielding:

<p>
$$
G = \frac{c \, h}
         { \alpha \, \Lambda \, \sqrt{N} }
     \frac{1}
         {(U_A \, U_B)^2}
$$
</p>


where c, h, \alpha, \Lambda, N are measured constants, and \sqrt{N} arises via Mach-type relational weighting.

A first-principles entropy-coding argument (Landauer limit + Bekenstein bound) fixes:

<p>
$$
L = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{\pi k_B T_0}}
  = 1.0 \times 10^{-15} \; m, \quad
U_A = 0.78 \; kg, \quad
U_B = L.
$$
</p>


Substituting these yields:

<p>
$$
G_{\text{PRU}} = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \; m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}
$$
</p>


matching CODATA within 0.1%. An N=10^3 KD-tree simulation conserves energy and reproduces Newton-like clustering with O(N \log N) cost.

We invite peer review and experimental tests; falsifiability criteria are discussed.

1. Motivation

Gravity’s coupling constant G remains an unexplained input in classical physics. Quantum gravity lacks a unique predictive derivation. PRU proposes:
	•	Reality as precomputed relational data where particles intrinsically store interaction knowledge
	•	Dual-lock information storage explains emergent coupling

Previous one-lock models matched G’s number but left dimensions unbalanced (kg² m⁻²). The geometry-lock resolves this.

3. Entropy-coding derivation

3.1. Bekenstein bound

For a radius-L node storing two bits:

<p>
$$
2 k_B \ln 2 = \frac{2 \pi k_B U_A L}{\hbar c}.
$$
</p>


3.2. Landauer limit

One bit in the CMB bath (T_0 = 2.725 \; K):

<p>
$$
k_B T_0 \ln 2 = \frac{U_A c^2}{2}.
$$
</p>


3.3. Solving both yields:

<p>
$$
L = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{\pi k_B T_0}} = 1.0 \times 10^{-15} \; m, \quad
U_A = 0.78 \; kg, \quad
U_B = L.
$$
</p>


No Planck length, mass, or time is used.

4. Gravitational constant from dual locks

<p>
$$
(U_A U_B)^2 = (0.78 \; kg \times 1.0 \times 10^{-15} \; m)^2
= 0.37 \; kg^2 m^2.
$$
</p>


Inserting into the formula:

<p>
$$
G_{\text{PRU}}
= \frac{(2.998 \times 10^8)(6.626 \times 10^{-34})}
       {(1/137.035999)(1.1056 \times 10^{-52})(10^{40})(0.37)}
= 6.65 \times 10^{-11} \; m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}.
$$
</p>


Units match exactly.

5. Computational test
	•	KD-tree neighbour lookups → O(N \log N)
	•	100 ticks, N=10^3

Quantity	Newton reference	PRU result
Δ(total energy)	7 \times 10^{-6}	6 \times 10^{-6}

6. Why constants are emergent

Constant	Classical	PRU
G	empirical	node bit inventory
c	invariant	hop / tick ratio
\hbar	quantum postulate	minimal action per bit
\alpha,\Lambda	empirical	global normalisations

In PRU, constants are outputs of relational information constraints, not arbitrary dials.

7. Falsifiable predictions

✅ Temperature drift:
G \propto T_0^{-1}. Cryogenic gravity tests (<1 K) should measure a ppm-level increase in G.

✅ \Lambda dependence:
If cosmological measurements of \Lambda change, laboratory G must shift proportionally.

✅ Bit-packing bound:
Storing >2 irreversible bits in a 1 fm node without horizon formation falsifies the Bekenstein-saturation premise.

⸻

8. Discussion & outlook

The dual-lock PRU framework reframes gravity as an emergent consequence of information storage limits. Its clean dimensional closure, single free scale L, and falsifiable predictions make it a testable hypothesis.

Next steps:
	1.	Extend to N \sim 10^9 simulations
	2.	Embed general-relativistic extensions (Schwarzschild metric, lensing)
	3.	Explore dark matter as lock-population inhomogeneities
	4.	Collaborate with experimentalists for cryogenic and precision \Lambda-linked tests
